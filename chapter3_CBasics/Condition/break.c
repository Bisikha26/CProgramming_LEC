// Both “break” and “continue” are the ‘jump’ statements, that transfer control of the program to another part of the program. 
// The main difference between break and continue is that break is used for immediate termination of loop. 
// ‘continue’ terminate the current iteration and resumes the control to the next iteration of the loop.

// The break statement is primarily used as the exit statement
// the continue statement helps in jumping from the current loop iteration to the next loop.
