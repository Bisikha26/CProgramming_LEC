## Why files are needed ?
### When a program is terminated, the entire data is lost. Storing in a file will preserve your data even if the program terminates.
### If you have to enter a large number of data, it will take a lot of time to enter them all.

## However, if you have a file containing all the data, you can easily access the contents of the file using a few commands in C.

### You can easily move your data from one computer to another without any changes.
